# Regex101-Clone
The webpage allows the functionality same as that of regex101.com. You can enter the text and search for sub-strings in the text. The webpage returns whether the sub-string is present in the text or not.

If the sub-string is present in the text it also returns the number of times the sub-string gets repeated in the text and the position where the syb-string is occurring.
